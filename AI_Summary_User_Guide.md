# AI Summary Feature User Guide

## Overview
The "Generate AI Summary" button creates 5-bullet point summaries for all government contract descriptions in your current view.

## Button Location
- Located next to the "Go To Project Tracker" button
- Same size and styling for consistency
- Features a ü§ñ AI icon

## How It Works

### 1. Pre-Check (API Key Validation)
When you click "Generate AI Summary", the system first checks if OpenAI API key is configured:

**‚úÖ If API Key is Configured:**
- Proceeds to generate summaries for all rows
- Shows progress: "Processing... X/Y completed"
- Displays individual summaries in each row

**‚ùå If API Key is NOT Configured:**
- Shows immediate alert: "‚ö†Ô∏è OpenAI API key is not configured!"
- Provides clear instructions to set up the API key
- Stops processing to avoid showing "0 successful summaries"

### 2. Bulk Processing
- Processes ALL visible rows at once
- Shows real-time progress on the button
- 200ms delay between requests to avoid API rate limits
- Individual error handling per row

### 3. Results Display
Each row's AI summary appears in the blue-tinted box above the manual highlights input.

### 4. Completion Message
The system shows different messages based on results:

**API Key Missing:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è All summaries failed because OpenAI API key is not configured.

To enable AI summaries:
1. Set OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable
2. Restart the application
3. Try generating summaries again
```

**Partial Success:**
```
AI Summary generation completed!
Processed: 10 rows
Successful: 7 summaries

Some rows failed to generate summaries. Check individual row error messages for details.
```

**Complete Success:**
```
AI Summary generation completed!
Processed: 10 rows
Successful: 10 summaries
```

## Setting Up OpenAI API Key

### Windows:
```bash
set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Linux/Mac:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Then restart the Flask application.
